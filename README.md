Our Package:
Our package will involve gathering tweets from and about Starbucks through functions we create. This will involve webscraping, text mining and sentiment analysis, and plotting. This package can be used to get the new tweets at any time.

Our Roles:

Erin
- Webscraping of Starbucks Tweets (tweets from the Starbucks Twitter, tweets including the keyword "Starbucks")
- Start building the package

Sarah
- Sentiment Analysis Functions using Twitter Data

Amy
- Plotting and Visualization Functions

We plan to all work together to start scraping in class on November 27 and help each other. We will compile the package together after we have each completed our own parts.
